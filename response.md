The Employee Leave Policy of AKAIWorks LLP is designed to outline the procedures, expectations, and entitlements regarding time off from work for all employees. This policy ensures that employees have the opportunity to take necessary leave for personal, medical, or family reasons while maintaining the smooth operation of the organization. It is important that all employees understand and adhere to the guidelines within this document to foster a fair and transparent process for all parties involved. At AKAIWorks LLP, we recognize the importance of balancing work and personal life and strive to provide a comprehensive leave program that meets the needs of our workforce.

**Objectives:**
- Ensure fair and consistent administration of leave across the organization.
- Comply with relevant legal regulations governing employee leave rights.

**Applicability of the Policy:**
This policy applies to all employees of AKAIWorks LLP, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees unless otherwise stated. In the case of any inconsistency between this policy and applicable labor laws, the legal provisions will take precedence. By clearly defining the company's leave expectations and responsibilities, we aim to ensure that employees have the flexibility to manage personal matters and maintain their well-being while also ensuring that business needs are met with minimal disruption.

**Rehiring of Former Employees:**
If a former employee is rehired by AKAIWorks LLP, the treatment of their previous leave balances will be decided based on the circumstances of their separation. If the employee resigned in good standing, unused leave may be carried over, subject to management approval. However, if the employee was terminated or left under circumstances where leave encashment was made, the accrued leave from the previous employment period will not be reinstated. Any leave accrued during the period of reemployment will be subject to the regular leave accrual policies of the company.

**Disciplinary Actions for Leave Violations:**
